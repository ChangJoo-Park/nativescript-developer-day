            NativeScript is a free and open-source runtime for building native apps using familiar tools—Angular, JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS, and npm. NativeScript renders truly native user interfaces—giving your users the best performance and UX their devices can offer.<br><br>
            In this workshop you’ll learn what NativeScript is, how it works, and how to use the framework to build iOS and Android apps. You’ll also learn about TypeScript and Angular 2 from the ground up, as NativeScript builds on top of these two technologies. The workshop is hands-on; therefore, if possible, come with <a href="http://docs.nativescript.org/angular/start/quick-setup.html">NativeScript installed</a> on your development machine and ready to go.<br><br>
            Come learn how to build native apps with NativeScript and Angular 2!
