        description: "We invite you to take an exhilarating adventure into the wildly interesting and abundantly vast terrain of NativeScript plugin building. Join the nStudio team to meet 3 of the communities top plugin developers, Nathan Walker, Brad Martin and Nathanael Anderson, to dive deep into best practices when harnessing the power and versatility of rich languages like Objective C, Swift and Java inside NativeScript. Whether you are seeking to learn more about custom plugin development (service layer to specialized view components) or longing for a better understanding of how these languages can be used in NativeScript, this workshop is for you."

Fortunately, Jeff has made every mistake in the book. In this talk, Jeff will go over the high level concepts involved with Angular (ex. TypeScript, DI, AoT, etc.), but will also provide his detailed opinions on important best practices that may help you avoid the same mistakes as you build some wicked awesome Angular apps."

        start_time: "3:00pm-4:30pm"
        description: "NativeScript has opened up a whole new world to Angular developers: the ability to share code directly between your web and native iOS/Android applications. Which is awesome! But, just because you can share code across multiple platforms, doesn’t mean that you necessarily should.
        
        In this talk we’ll first take a look at what NativeScript makes possible from a code sharing perspective. We’ll build a few Angular components and use them both in the browser and on mobile devices. Then we’ll take a step back and look at the same code from a pragmatic, maintenance-oriented perspective. Come for practical tips & tricks on sharing code across multiple development environments."
