        description: >
            NativeScript is a free and open-source runtime for building native apps using familiar tools—Angular, JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS, and npm. NativeScript renders truly native user interfaces—giving your users the best performance and UX their devices can offer.<br><br>
            In this workshop you’ll learn what NativeScript is, how it works, and how to use the framework to build iOS and Android apps. You’ll also learn about TypeScript and Angular 2 from the ground up, as NativeScript builds on top of these two technologies. The workshop is hands-on; therefore, if possible, come with [NativeScript installed](http://docs.nativescript.org/angular/start/quick-setup.html) on your development machine and ready to go.<br><br>
            Come learn how to build native apps with NativeScript and Angular 2!

        description: "Three years ago some engineers at Telerik begin working on a mobile framework that could help turn web developers into mobile developers. Not mobile web developers or hybrid developers, but true native mobile developers. Over two years later, that framework was released as the open source project called NativeScript.\n\nWe've come a long way since then, but it's really just the beginning. Let's take a look together at the true story of why we built NativeScript, an exciting look at our future plans, as well as some exclusive NativeScript announcements."

        description: "NativeScript provides a radically different value proposition for building mobile apps for startups, enterprises, and any kind of SaaS company already using Angular 2. By removing the performance barrier for more complex mobile apps, NativeScript enables a new cross-channel application strategy that wasn’t available a year ago and is a game changer for many kinds of mobile applications. Join Nick as he shares lessons learned from dozens of mobile projects, including several NativeScript ones, over the last three years."

        start_time: "11:15am"
        description: "With great power comes great…complexity? You can do so many new and amazing things with Angular 2 that just aren't feasible with Angular 1, but the tool chain required to get it all working can be daunting. The mental hurdles to overcome can be even worse when you add Angular Universal to the mix and have to consider running your app on multiple platforms (i.e. in the browser, on the web server and on a mobile device). Fortunately, the Angular core team and many Angular 2 libraries (including Angular Universal) have started to place a much bigger emphasis on the CLI and simplifying the tool chain in order to make setup and maintenance much easier. In this talk, Jeff will go over how to set up a new Universal app using all this good stuff and discuss several supporting services that you should be using when you want to run your Angular 2 app in multiple environments."

        description: "NativeScript is not limited to just building sleek and beautiful apps. Its versatility lets us go beyond the boundaries of a mobile screen and enter the &quot;cyber-brain&quot; of a MiP robot. In this talk you will see how to establish a connection with MiP robot (close cousin to the T-800) and how to create a NativeScript remote controller to move the robot around the stage. To do that we will use the MiP BLE Protocol to communicate with the machine via Bluetooth. We will also look into direct integration with the native iOS and Android SDKs and how to turn them into a cross platform module. You can expect to see a real robot controlled with a NativeScript app. After the session I will share the code with you, so that you could get your own robot to protect your desk at work."
